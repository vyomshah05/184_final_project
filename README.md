# 184_final_project

Set the file paths on code cells 3 and 4 where it shows:
```python
norm_counts_path = 'Path to GSE68086_norm_counts_TPM_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv'
```
and
```python
labels_path = "path to Data/GSE68086_series_matrix.txt"
```
And replace them with the paths for:
data/GSE68086_norm_counts_TPM_GRCh38.p13_NCBI.tsv and data/GSE68086_series_matrix.txt respectively

The rest of the notebook should run perfectly on any device after that. We used Google Colab for our environment and is the reason behind to drive code block at the top. DELETE the first code block with google drive if not using colab.
